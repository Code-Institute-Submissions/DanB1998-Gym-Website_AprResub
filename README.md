# HTML-CSS-Website

# Overview

This project is from the perspective of a gym business looking to advertise itself in a webpage. It will encourage people to get into fitness as well as offering classes and shoeing pricing information and even have methods of contacting the business in a form.

The aim of the website is to be attractive, easy to use and simple to navigate. This means all users shouldn't have an issue getting to all of the content and interacting with the website where possible.

# User Stories

* To be able to directly contact the business using a form, so any questions can be submitted.

* Find links to business' social media and other contacts so their online presence can grow.

As a returning user:

* To be able to find information such as class times and membership prices.

* Ask a question or revisit any business information quickly and easily.

# Structure

I used bootstrap to make the majority of my webpage reponsive and to give the page its structure. Bootstrap allows the website to be scaled down onto smaller devices as it will restructure the webpage as the dimensions of the page change. This will increase the amount of browsers my website can be viewed on so I am not restricted by the device that the pages viewers are using.

# Features 

## Nav Bar

The Nav Bar is designed to be simple and easy to use. The links will disappear and a clickable dropdown menu will appear when the media query is triggered. This makes the nav bar responsive on all devices.
